# Updates list:
2025/04/28 - Update 00009p. Added update list to README.md. Also:
- Since today and until I notify you all wsh is freezed. I'm gonna update only useradd command. Wsh can't be used at the moment in my system so I need some things for it. It is the only reason why I decided to freeze development
- rm, rmdir - added to wsh
- fixed: ls, cd, touch, mkdir
